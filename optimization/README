INSTALLATION
    Designed for Linux systems. Installation from Makefile. Simply use make. Output is "prvnet" executable.

EXTERNAL SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FOR INSTALLATION
    MSAMDD requires the installation of IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio to solve its mathematical programming models. 
    CPLEX may be downloaded from https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio
    CPLEX should be installed in the opt/ibm/ILOG directory at the root folder of the Linux system. 
    MSAMDD automatically detects and uses the latest version at this directory. In case CPLEX is installed in a different directory, 
    the user must change the default directory in the Makefile at line 5.
